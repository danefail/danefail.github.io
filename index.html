	<p>
	  DANE is a standard that allows TLS certificates to be bound to DNS names using DNSSEC.
	  As of today (2017), one of its most prominent uses is for email; bringing transport
	  encryption to SMTP. A few major MTAs (such as Postfix, Cloudmark and Halon) supports
	  it, and a growing number of domains are being signed.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If domain is DNSSEC-signed, but its DNS server fail to give proper answers in response
	  to TLSA queries, email delivery to this domain will fail for senders using DANE. The
	  most common problem is servers responding with SERVFAIL.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This is a verified list of DNSSEC-signed domains, which doesn't give proper TLSA
	  responses, and therefore needs to be excluded from DANE verification, in order to have
	  email delivered to them.

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/danefail/list/blob/master/tools/dane_fail_postfix">Postfix</a> (smtp_tls_policy_maps)</li>	
			<li><a href="https://github.com/danefail/list/blob/master/tools/halon">Halon</a> (pre-delivery script)</li>	
		</ul>	
	</p>
	<h4>Maintenance</h4>
	<p>
	  This list is maintained and used by several organisations, and the domain name
	  is as of now under the administration of <a href="https://wiki.halon.se">Halon</a>.
